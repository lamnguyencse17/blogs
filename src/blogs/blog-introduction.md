## Another blog?

It's never enough. It's just like every other blog. It's about my personal experience: What I've been learning, How to improve stuff, My thought process.

It's more like a personal engineering blog that journals what problems I've come acrossed, what I have in my mind to improve stuff

It's engineering stuff but I would never think of going too professional or going too technical so you will be more likely to find stuff here so niche for people looking for specific things

## What to do with this blog?

Each blog will, hopefully, come to you with a some level of familiarity but with a twist like "Huh, I actually never thought about that" or "Probably, I can do this with my own stuff"

I don't do complicated stuff. I do simple stuff with an good return in result and I hope everyone to apply what I've been sharing to their everyday work.

Don't wait for this to be updated. I am lazy.

Contact me if I mess things up. I am so subjective that I may suffer from it.

Have fun.
